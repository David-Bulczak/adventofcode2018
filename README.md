# adventofcode2018

I want to take this years (2018) advent of code as a chance to learn C#. This means that I priorize using C#'s features sets over elegant or compact solutions. Still every kind of feedback and hints for improvement are welcome. 

Thus in short here are my goals:
### Major goals
- Learn C#
    - Syntax
    - Core features
    - Advanced features
    - Library
    - Best practices
- Having fun

### Minor goals 
- Elegant solutions
- Use/develop fancy algorithms to solve problems
